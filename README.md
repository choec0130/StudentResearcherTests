Please write complete a first draft of a classifier in python and provide an analysis of how well it performs according to the following instructions:
2.1.    You are attempting to classify whether a given chunk of text describes a commercial establishment that offers office space for rent

2.2.    Download the data from this link: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ra-training/ra_data_classifier.csv

2.3.    Use any classification method you want on the data

2.4.    Write a short explanation of your methodology and how your classifier performs

2.5.    Beyond a minimal bar of technical competence, you will be assessed largely on the clarity of your write-up. Do not spend too much time perfecting your classifier

 

Create a simple API
3.1.    Download the data from this link: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ra-training/ra_data_classifier.csv

3.2.    Create a working API that is web accessible that:

3.2.1. responds to GET or POST requests containing a JSON object requesting a piece of data with a particular “hid”

3.2.2. Returns a JSON object with the full record for the piece of data with that particular “hid”

3.3.    Write up a short piece of documentation providing enough detail for me to access the API
